    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Support Vector Machines(SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines can be used for image classification and it also perfomes well for face detection as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of SVM:-\n",
    "1. SVM is effective for high dimesinal space , where there are lot of features\n",
    "2. It can model non linear data as well\n",
    "3. It uses the kernel trick , which can be completely customized if required\n",
    "Weaknesses of SVM:-\n",
    "1. SVM is slow for large data sets , so training is time consuming\n",
    "2. SVM sometimes doesn't give good results if there is lot of overlap in data\n",
    "3. It also trickier to tune , because there are lot of kernels to choose from\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a good fit becase usally in real world data is non linear and in this case we have more than  100 features and 10K data . Also , looks like there are features , which can clearly segregate the income group\n",

    "1. Adaboost algoithm is fast compared to other classification modeles like SVM\n",
    "2. As it works on iterative training method and as explained in videos , it gives more weight to misclassified data point in each iteration , which increases models accuracy\n",
    "Weakness of Adaboost:-\n",
    "1. If we use a complex or bias base model, it will lead to overfitting of the data\n",
    "2. Bad data without proper preprocessing , will lead to low accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of finding donors , data seem to be clean and we already done some data preprosessing. It can give results. Also ensemble methods are one the of good classifiers and they can iterate fast to give good accuracy\n",

    "2.  Simple to understand, visualize and interpret\n",
    "3. Doesn't require lot of data processing \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness of Decision Trees:-\n",
    "1. Can easily overfitt the training data, covering all the cases\n",
    "2. Doesn't generalizes very well with data\n",

    "**Answer: ** After looking at the performance of models, both in training and test datasets. I think Adaboost classifier is best suited to solve this problem. As it can be seen in the graphs , in comparison to SVM and decision tree adaboost is performing consistently well for both training and test data sets . Accuracy score of adaboost for all testing sizes 1% to 100% is better than both SVM and decision. Decision tree is performing very well in training data set , it means its overfitting , where in SVM is close in terms of accuracy , but its taking way too much time to run for small data sets which is not desirable. For F-score , adaboost is performing better than both SVC and  decision.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Adaboost is a ensemble type of model which means it works by combining mutiple simple learning models(like decision trees) , to create a ensemble of learners in order to classify in this case whether an individual earns more than 50K or not. Each of the weak models work on specific features as in case of finding donors (age,location, capital gain etc). Adaboost algorithm trains iteratively and tries to correctly classify data. In each itertation , it tries to classify misclassified data by giving them higher weights . This iteration will be repeated multiple times till we can't improve the predictions . Then all te learners (we got in each iterations) are combined to make ensemble of models "

Visializtions are mostly similar to my intution . But their rankings are little different. I missed capital-loss , which is as important as capital-gain , if you have made losses . It's more objective feature than workclass."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If training time was a important , reducing data and feature will reduce training time as well. If the problem is not business critical m and there's a tradeoff for training data , we can reduce the data set since the accuracy and F-score impact is not huge"
